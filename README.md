# Dodge the Creeps
[Dodge the Creeps](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) is a basic Godot starter tutorial meant to teach new users about the engine. I'm keeping my own progress on the tutorial here, as well as some scenes from related tutorials. To take a look at it, simply clone the repo and open it up in Godot.
